Blaster Mac Client — run on this Mac
====================================

1. Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal).

2. Go into the folder:
   cd blaster-mac-client

3. Run the app once (first run installs dependencies):
   chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
   Stop with Ctrl+C when done testing.

4. Install to run at login (optional):
   chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
   The client will start automatically when you log in and restart if it crashes.
   Logs: logs/stdout.log and logs/stderr.log
   To disable: launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.blaster-mac-client.plist

Requirements: macOS with Bluetooth; IR Blaster powered, in range, and paired with this Mac.
